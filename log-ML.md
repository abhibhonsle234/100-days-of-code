### Day 1: Oct 19, 2019 
**Today's Progress:** Went through first chapter of book5. Refreshed operations with ipython on jupyter notebook. Did EDA and validation assignments and quizes on coursera HWDC.<br>
**Thoughts:** restricting yourself to doing just one thing is a bit difficult<br>
**Link to work:** will push my own repo for Book5

### Day 2: Oct 20, 2019 
**Today's Progress:** Completed peer graded assignment for week 2 of HWDC on data leakages. went through second chpter of book 5. Refereshed operations with numpy including basics, ufuncs, aggregations, slicing, and spliting etc.<br>
**Thoughts:** Move to something incredible requires doind things more incredibly<br>
**Link to work:** will push my own repo for book 5 soon and HWDC once completed

### Day 3: Oct 21, 2019 
**Today's Progress:** Completed chapter 1 exercises of book 2 on pipelining. Completed chapter 2 of book 5. advanced numpy operations<br>
**Thoughts:** keep pushing that threshold<br>
**Link to work:** will push my own repo for book 5 soon

### Day 4: Oct 22, 2019 
**Today's Progress:** Went through chapter 3 of book 5. Basic pandas series and dataframe operations- creation, indexing, slicing, ufuncs<br>
**Thoughts:** Adjust to the speed of life<br>
**Link to work:** will push my own repo for book 5 soon

### Day 5: Oct 24, 2019 
**Today's Progress:** Went through chapter 3 of book 5. worked with missing data and multi-index.<br>
**Thoughts/Quote:** This has become rather innocuous as the days pass by.<br>
