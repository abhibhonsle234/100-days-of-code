### Day 1: February 4, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Finally pushed through stalemate of free code camp data visaulization project 1 : bar chart. Dealt with mysql and succeeding popsql installation on newly accomodated linux system. Completed first run through of pending Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Mueller and Sarah Guido  
**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit with scaling and stubborn self for making bar chart visualization responsive.

### Day 3: February 6, 2019 
**Today's Progress**: Tweaked code of FCC bar chart project to pass tests. Learnt about tick formating in D3.js. Ran nested queries on company database consisting of 5 relations. Started reading Hands on Machine Learning with scikit learn and tensorflow by Aurélien	Géron.
**Thoughts:** Following the approcah of testing my knowledge through questions of the respective chapter(of the book) before going through it seems good. Date formating seems to be quite tricky for setting ticks of x-axis.
