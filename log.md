# 100 Days Of Code - Log

## Plan of action - not sure what to and what not to include here! 

### Day 1: February 4, 2019 

**Today's Progress**: Finally pushed through stalemate of free code camp data visaulization project 1 : bar chart. Dealt with mysql and succeeding popsql installation on newly accomodated linux system. Completed first run through of pending Introduction to Machine Learning with Python by Andreas C. Mueller and Sarah Guido  

**Thoughts:** Struggled a bit with scaling and stubborn self for making bar chart visualization responsive.
